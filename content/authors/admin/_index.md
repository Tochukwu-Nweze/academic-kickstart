I am interested in how psycho-socioeconomic adversities in early life affects brain development and cognitive functions across the lifespan. In my first project I will use psychometric techniques to determine if early life adversities can be characterized into distinct classes, and explore the possible deficits and/or adaptation in various cognitive facets in these classes of adverse-exposed individuals.
